    abstract = { A meta-analysis of the relationship between class attendance in college and college grades reveals that attendance has strong relationships with both class grades (k = 69, N = 21,195, ρ = .44) and GPA (k = 33, N = 9,243, ρ = .41). These relationships make class attendance a better predictor of college grades than any other known predictor of academic performance, including scores on standardized admissions tests such as the SAT, high school GPA, study habits, and study skills. Results also show that class attendance explains large amounts of unique variance in college grades because of its relative independence from SAT scores and high school GPA and weak relationship with student characteristics such as conscientiousness and motivation. Mandatory attendance policies appear to have a small positive impact on average grades (k = 3, N = 1,421, d = .21). Implications for theoretical frameworks of student academic performance and educational policy are discussed. }

abstract = {Effective student attendance management in higher educational institutions represents a big challenge for faculty members that need fast and accurate approaches. The traditional attendance manual approach is prone to spoofing and wasting a lot of faculty/students time and poor accuracy especially in the case of large student numbers. This paper presents an effective solution for the real-time student attendance management problem in large lecture halls. Fast response time and high accuracy imply using high-speed technologies and processes for student identification. In this paper, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and novel face recognition and identification approaches have been proposed and evaluated. A multimodal approach for student identification combined the power of both the traditional RFID approach and Multi-Scale Structural Similarity (MS-SSIM) index. Capturing the authentic face variability from a sequence of video frames has been considered for the recognition of faces and resulted in system robustness against the variability of facial features. Experimental results indicated an improvement in the performance of the proposed system compared to the state-of-the-art approaches at a rate between 2% and 5%. In addition, it decreased the time three times if compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, such as Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Finally, it achieved an accuracy of 99%.}

abstract = {As text-based passwords continue to be the dominant form for user identification today, services try to protect their costumers by offering enhanced, and more secure, technologies for authentication. One of the most promising is two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA raises the bar for the attacker significantly, however, it is still questionable if the technology can be realistically adopted by the majority of Internet users. In this paper, we attempt a first study for quantifying the adoption of 2FA in probably the largest existing provider, namely Google. For achieving this, we leverage the password-reminder process in a novel way for discovering if 2FA is enabled for a particular account, without annoying or affecting the account's owner. Our technique has many challenges to overcome, since it requires issuing massively thousands of password reminders. In order to remain below the radar, and therefore avoid solving CAPTCHAs or having our hosts blocked, we leverage distributed systems, such as TOR and PlanetLab. After examining over 100,000 Google accounts, we conclude that 2FA has not yet been adopted by more than 6.4\% of the users. Last but not least, as a side-effect of our technique, we are also able to exfiltrate private information, which can be potentially used for malicious purposes. Thus, in this paper we additionally present important findings for raising concerns about privacy risks in designing password reminders.},

abstract="One challenging problem in managing large systems is the complexity of security administration. Security administration entails, among other tasks, assigning and revoking authorizations to subjects on the objects to be protected. Whenever the number of subjects and objects is high, the number of such authorizations can become extremely large. If, moreover, the user population is highly dynamic, the number of grant and revoke operations to be performed can become very difficult to manage. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) has been proposed as an alternative approach to traditional discretionary and mandatory access control with the goal of simplifying authorization administration [Ferraiolo et al., 2001].",

abstract = {Abstract Higher education institutions are continuing to develop their capacity for learning analytics (LA), which is a sociotechnical data-mining and analytic practice. Institutions rarely inform their students about LA practices, and there exist significant privacy concerns. Without a clear student voice in the design of LA, institutions put themselves in an ethical gray area. To help fill this gap in practice and add to the growing literature on students' privacy perspectives, this study reports findings from over 100 interviews with undergraduate students at eight U.S. higher education institutions. Findings demonstrate that students lacked awareness of educational data-mining and analytic practices, as well as the data on which they rely. Students see potential in LA, but they presented nuanced arguments about when and with whom data should be shared; they also expressed why informed consent was valuable and necessary. The study uncovered perspectives on institutional trust that were heretofore unknown, as well as what actions might violate that trust. Institutions must balance their desire to implement LA with their obligation to educate students about their analytic practices and treat them as partners in the design of analytic strategies reliant on student data in order to protect their intellectual privacy.},
